        <div class = 'general-content possible-active-content'>My name is Konstantin Loktev, I'm a 19-year-old student. I wish to try myself as a JavaScript developer. I don't feel certain about whether I want to pursuit a FrontEnd or a FullStack career, though I lean towards the former. There is no particular reason for my intention to join JS Camping specifically; I perceive it as an opportunity to enter the world of IT and see whether my skills and teachability will suffice and be enough for me to join a dev team.</div>
